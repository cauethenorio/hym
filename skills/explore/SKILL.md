description: Use when you want to understand the codebase without a specific task, explore how something works, or when you're not sure what you're looking for yet.

# Explore

## Overview

Free-form exploration of the codebase. No task, no deliverable — just understanding. Help the dev figure out what they want to understand, even when they can't articulate it yet.

## Before Anything Else

1. Read CLAUDE.md and repo structure
2. Read `.claude/project-instructions/explore.md` if it exists
   - These instructions are ADDITIVE — they do not replace this skill

## Process

1. **Understand the goal — or help find it**
   - Ask the dev what they want to understand
   - If they're not sure, help them figure it out:
     - "What triggered your curiosity?"
     - "Is there something specific that confused you?"
     - "Are you trying to understand a feature, a pattern, or the architecture?"
     - "Did you see something in the code that surprised you?"
   - Through questions, help the dev clarify their own goal

2. **Explore together**
   - Read files, trace flows, explain patterns
   - Follow the dev's curiosity — let them steer
   - If you find something interesting or unexpected, point it out
   - Connect what you find to the broader architecture

3. **Keep it conversational**
   - One topic at a time
   - Ask "does this answer your question?" before moving on
   - If the dev's question evolves, follow it
   - No rush — understanding takes time

## What This Skill Does NOT Do

- Produce output artifacts (no docs, no files)
- Follow a rigid structure
- Have a "done" state — it ends when the dev's curiosity is satisfied

## Key Principles

- **Help them find the question** — the dev might not know what they're looking for
- **Follow curiosity** — let the dev steer, don't impose a structure
- **Read the code** — don't explain from memory, read the actual files
- **Connect the dots** — relate what you find to the bigger picture
- **It's OK to say "I don't know, let's look"** — explore together
