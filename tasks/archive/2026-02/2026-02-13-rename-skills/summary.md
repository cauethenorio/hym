# Rename execute-implementation and verify-before-completing
Date: 2026-02-13
Commit: c62c612

## Summary
Renamed two skills to follow the project's verb-first naming convention: `execute-implementation` became `follow-recipe` (pairing naturally with `write-task-recipe`) and `verify-before-completing` became `verify-work` (concise, action-oriented). Updated all references across 11 files. No behavioral changes.

## Artifacts
- blueprint.md — Design document
- recipe.md — Implementation steps
